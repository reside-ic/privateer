## Usage

```Usage:
  privateer --version
  privateer backup <path> --to=HOST [--exclude=TARGETS] [--include=TARGETS]
  privateer restore <path> --from=HOST [--exclude=TARGETS] [--include=TARGETS]
  privateer schedule <path> --to=HOST [--exclude=TARGETS] [--include=TARGETS]
  privateer status
  privateer cancel [--host=HOST]

Options:
  --exclude=TARGETS  Comma separated string of target names to exclude (default is to include all)
  --include=TARGETS  Comma separated string of target names to include (default is to include all)
  --host=HOST  Backup host to cancel scheduled backups for (default is to cancel all)
```

`<path>` is the path to a directory containing a `privateer.json` file. This file should contain at least one target 
and at least one host. See `./config/privateer.json` for an example. By default all targets in the config file are used, 
but this can be overridden by explicitly including or excluding targets by name. Backups can be scheduled to multiple 
hosts simultaneously by running `privateer schedule` multiple times.

## Test and lint

1. `hatch run test`
2. `hatch run lint:fmt`

To get coverage reported locally in the console, use `hatch run cov`. 
On CI, use `hatch run cov-ci` to generate an xml report.

## Installation

```console
pip install privateer
```

## Install from local sources

1. `hatch build`
2. `pip install dist/privateer-{version}.tar.gz`

## Publish to PyPi

Ensure you have built a new version of the package:
1. `hatch clean`
2. `hatch build`

Then publish to the test server:

```console
hatch publish -r test
```

You will be prompted to enter your [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/legacy/) username and password.
To test the installation, first run Python in a container:

```
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash python
```

Then:

```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple privateer --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple
```

Now you should be able to run `privateer` from the command line and see the usage instructions.

If it is working, you can publish to the real PyPi:

```console
hatch publish
```
