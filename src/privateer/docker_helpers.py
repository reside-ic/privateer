# There is an annoyance with docker and the requests library, where
# when the http handle is reclaimed a warning is printed.  It makes
# the test log almost impossible to read.

# This little helper can be used with python's with statement as

#      with DockerClient() as cl:
#        cl.containers...
#
# and will close *most* unused handles on exit.  It's easier to look
# at than endless try/finally blocks everywhere.
